# Candidate Search

## Description
The application's API, which retrieves data from the GitHub API, has already been created. It's your job to complete the front end using TypeScript, call the application's API, and then deploy the entire application to Render.

### User Story

```md
AS AN employer
I WANT a candidate search application
SO THAT I can hire the best candidates
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a candidate search application
WHEN the candidate search page loads
THEN the information for one candidate should be displayed, including the candidate's name, username, location, avatar, email, html_url, and company
WHEN I click the "+" button
THEN the candidate should be saved to the list of potential candidates and the next candidate's information should be displayed
WHEN I click the "-" button
THEN the next candidate's information should be displayed without saving the current candidate
WHEN there are no candidates available to review
THEN an appropriate message should be shown indicating no more candidates are available
WHEN the potential candidates page loads
THEN the user should see a list of previously saved potential candidates with their name, username, location, avatar, email, html_url, and company
WHEN the page reloads
THEN the list of potential candidates should persist and be available for viewing
WHEN there are no potential candidates
THEN an appropriate message should be displayed indicating no candidates have been accepted
